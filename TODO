Auto_Function_Wrapper: Clean up argument definitions

Implicit and other type conversions:

  The idea here is that we can tell Rice which types have been defined to have
  automatic conversions. For example, Ogre::Degree and Ogre::Radian are defined
  to be used interchangably, and any numerical conversions happen in each class.

  boost::python exposes a completely seperate declaration method: implicitly_convertible<from, to>
  I'm going to try having it as a method on Data_Type, but I may need to go the same route
  depending on if bi-directional requires this, say:

  implicitly_convertible<Ogre::Degree, Ogre::Radian>();
  implicitly_convertible<Ogre::Radian, Ogre::Degree>();

  Due to Rice's and Ruby's differing handling of defined types and fundamental types (int, float, etc),
  special care needs to be taken to ensure both conversions work

  I want to be able to do:

    struct Real
    {
      Real(int x)
        : v(x)
      {}

      operator int() const
      {
        return v;
      }

      int v;
    };

    define_class<Real>("Real")
      .define_constructor(Constructor<Real, int>())
      .implicit_cast_to<int>();

  or if there were a defined type that Real converts to and from:

    define_class<Real>("Real")
      .define_constructor(Constructor<Real, int>())
      .implicit_cast_to<Fake>();

    define_class<Fake>("Fake")
      .define_constructor(Constructor<Fake, int>())
      .implicit_cast_to<Real>();

  So the steps I'll need to take to make this work correctly are as follows:

  T from_ruby(Rice::Object x)
    - Check for direct match (exists)
    - Change casters to a multimap
    - Build new caster for implicit type conversion
      - Might need two ways of this: constructor or cast method.

    - Check for any implicit casts for type T
      - Try to build the list so that I don't have to actually cast anything
        unless I know it's the right type to cast to
      - How do I know what type I'm casting from? (the case of Real being given a FixNum)
      - Defined types to Defined types will be much simpler I believe
