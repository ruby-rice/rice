.. _std_string_view:

std::string_view
-----------------
``std::string_view`` is a read-only reference to a sequence of ``char``. It provides a way of passing strings without the overhead of copying ``std::string``.

On input, Rice treats ``std::string_view`` as a Builtin type which means it copies the portion of the ``char`` sequence that a ``std::string_view`` references in C++ to Ruby. Please refer to the :ref:`std_string` documentation to learn about how Rice handles encodings.

On output, Rice creates a ``std::string_view`` that references a Ruby string's underlying ``char`` buffer. Note this is DANGEROUS. Sooner or later the Ruby string will be garbage collected or moved as part of compaction, thus invalidating the ``char`` buffer. So use this with caution.
