.. _Inheritance:

Inheritance
===========

Rice supports creating child classes via the ``define_class`` method:

.. code-block:: cpp

  class Base
  {
  public:
    virtual void foo();
  };

  class Derived
    : public Base
  {
  };

  extern "C"
  void Init_test()
  {
    Data_Type<Base> rb_cBase =
      define_class<Base>("Base")
      .define_method("foo", &Base::foo);

    Data_Type<Derived> rb_cDerived =
      define_class<Derived, Base>("Derived");
  }

This is done by adding a second template parameter to ``define_class`` that specifies that ``Derived`` inherits from ``Base``.

Rice does not support multiple inheritance.

Directors
----------
Inheritance becomes much more complex if you want to create Ruby classes that inherit from wrapped C++ classes. This introduces several problems:

* Ruby classes should be able to override C++ virtual methods
* Overriden virtual methods should be able to call ``super`` and invoke the overriden C++ method
* C++ code calling the virtual methods should invoke the overriden version in Ruby

Rice supports these use cases through the use of ``Director`` classes. ``Directors`` are proxies that can correctly dispatch method invocations up or down a Class hierarchy.

.. note::
  The name Director comes from SWIG - for more information see https://www.swig.org/Doc4.0/SWIGPlus.html#SWIGPlus_director_classes_introduction.

Take the following class:

.. code-block:: cpp

  class VirtualBase
  {
    public:
      VirtualBase();
      virtual int doWork();
      virtual int processWorker() = 0;
  };

Due to the abstract nature of this class, we cannot directly wrap it in Rice, as any C++ compiler will complain about trying to instantiate a virtual class. Even without the pure virtual function, any call to ``VirtualBase::doWork`` will stop at the C++ level and execution will not pass down into any Ruby subclasses.

To properly wrap both of these methods, use a ``Rice::Director`` subclass as a proxy and use this new proxy class as the type to wrap with ``define_class``:

.. code-block:: cpp

  #include <rice/rice.hpp>

  class VirtualBaseProxy : public VirtualBase, public Rice::Director
  {
    public:
      VirtualBaseProxy(Object self) : Rice::Director(self)
      { }

      virtual int doWork()
      {
        int result = getSelf().call("do_work");
        return detail::From_Ruby<int>().convert(result);
      }

      int default_doWork()
      {
        return VirtualBase::doWork();
      }

      virtual int processWorker()
      {
        int result = getSelf().call("process_worker");
        return detail::From_Ruby<int>().convert(result);
      }

      int default_processWorker()
      {
        raisePureVirtual();
      }
  };

There is a lot going on here, so we'll go through each part.

.. code-block:: cpp

  class VirtualBaseProxy : public Virtualbase, public Rice::Director { }

First, the class needs to subclass both the virtual class in question and ``Rice::Director``.

.. code-block:: cpp

    public:
      VirtualBaseProxy(Object self) : Rice::Director(self) { }

For ``Rice::Director`` to work its magic, every instance of this class needs to have a handle to its Ruby instance. The constructor must take a ``Rice::Object`` as the first argument and pass it to ``Rice::Director``.

Next we implement ``doWork``. The director class overrides its by forwarding the invocation to the Ruby instance.


.. code-block:: cpp

      virtual int doWork()
      {
        int result = getSelf().call("do_work");
        return detail::From_Ruby<int>().convert(result);
      }

      int default_doWork()
      {
        return VirtualBase::doWork();
      }

It director also implements ``default_doWork`` which enables Ruby to call the overriden virtual C++ method. The ``default_`` prefix is a naming convention to help keep straight which methods perform which functions.

If Ruby should never call the C++ method then the ``default_`` implementation should call ``raisePureVirtual()``:

.. code-block:: cpp

  int default_processWorker()
  {
    raisePureVirtual();
  }

The method ``raisePureVirtual()`` exists to allow wrapping a pure virtual method into Ruby (and ensuring compilation is possible) while also making sure any users of this extension are informed quickly if there is nothing callable on the C++ side.

Once the Director class is built, it's time to wrap it into Ruby:

.. code-block:: cpp

  extern "C"
  void Init_virtual() {
    define_class<VirtualBase>("VirtualBase")
      .define_director<VirtualBaseProxy>()
      .define_constructor(Constructor<VirtualBaseProxy, Rice::Object>())
      .define_method("do_work", &VirtualBaseProxy::default_doWork)
      .define_method("process_worker", &VirtualBaseProxy::default_processWorker);
  }

There are couple of new things in this code.

First, is the addition of the ``define_director`` call which takes the ``VirtualBaseProxy`` as a template parameter.

Second, the ``Constructor`` template parameter must also be the ``VirtualBaseProxy`` to allow proper object construction and destruction of the derived objects.

Third, the ``define_method`` calls should point to the ``default_*`` implementations.
