# This file tells RDoc which files to parse for documentation.
# We exclude the docs/ directory because it contains markdown files
# with C++ code snippets that confuse RDoc's encoding detection
# (e.g., "Encoding::utf8()" is misinterpreted as an encoding declaration).
#
# Rice extensions generate their own documentation using rice-doc,
# which is a separate system from RDoc. RDoc is not used to document
# the C++ code.
