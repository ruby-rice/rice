/* The Native Registry tracks C++ instance that are used to invoke C++ methods for Ruby. 
   These objects include instances of the NativeFunction, NativeIterator, NativeAttributeGet
   and NativeAttributeSet Each instance is specialized to call a specific C++ function, method
   or attribute that is exposed to Ruby.
   
   The registry stores these C++ instances using a map of vectors. The map is keyed on the 
   the Ruby class (VALUE) and method id (ID). The value is a vector of Native pointers stored
   in a std::unique_ptr. Thus the registry takes ownership of the pointers when calling
   code adds them to the registry. The value is a vector to support C++ method overloading.
   
   Note - when an existing Ruby class is redefined using rb_define_class, its VALUE stays the same
   but all its methods and fields are reset. Thus any call to rb_define_class must be followed
   by calling the reset method on the registry. Although redefinition shouldn't happen in 
   production code it happens in many places in the unit tests. */
